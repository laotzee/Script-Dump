# Auto-Like Tinker Script
The script opens Tinder.com, logs in with a phone number associated with a existing account, and waits for the user to finish the captcha. Once inside, enter is pressed on the terminal to dismiss the initial permissions, denying the notificacions and allowing location, the script press 'like' on every profile 100 times, being that the limit amount for the free users. In case any unforeseen pop-up, as promotions, the script stops and continues again once the user hits enter on the terminal.

# How to use
For using the script, a chromedriver and a phone number already registered on Tinder must be provided as values for CHROMEDRIVER and USER_NUMBER at the beginning of the script. Then the user needs to complete the captcha on the logging process.
